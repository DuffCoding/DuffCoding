- 👋 Hi, I’m @DuffCoding
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development and Videogame Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, MongoDB, Python, and Dash.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Web Development Projects, show my web development portfolio, and collaborate/work on N64 games/Mods.
- 📫 How to reach me: Once I have things established, I will update this information....

Web Development: I'm currently going through DevSlopes to become a Web Developer. I'm 2 modules away from being comfortable to work front end development jobs.

Videogame Development: I like what people have created in N64 mods. They made newer Banjo kazzooie games, as well as Super Smash 1.0.1. I would like to be apart of both groups in Git, but currently working on these goals.

Dream Job: Perfect world scenario, I get to work remotely(at least during the winter months, black ice is not fun to drive on) at a videogame company.
